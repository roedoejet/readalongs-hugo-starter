Grassroots Forest Defenders Establish Third Blockade to defend Vancouver Island Old Growth

Two Weeks into a Campaign to Halt Logging of Ancient Rainforests in the Last Intact Watershed of the San Juan River System, Activists Set Up Third Blockade on unceded Pacheedaht Territory.

Victoria, B.C. 8/23/2020

In the midst of an ongoing climate emergency, logging of the ancient rainforests continues at an unfettered rate. The amount of old growth forest logged each day on the island is equivalent to 32 soccer pitches (Wilderness Committee). These forests are not only vital for carbon sequestration, but also fundamental for the integrity of complex, interconnected ecosystems that support keystone and culturally significant species, such as salmon. Alarmingly, less than 2.7% of largest stature forest was found to be remaining on the Island (Last Stand for Biodiversity).

Grassroots forest defenders from across Vancouver Island have prevented Teal Jones Group from blasting logging roads into the headwaters of the Fairy Creek watershed for the past two weeks. The road would have penetratedthe last remaining intact, unlogged tributary in the entire San Juan river system. The tributary is near Port Renfrew on unceded Pacheedaht territory.

Last Sunday saw a second blockade established East of the Fairy Creek watershed. A third blockade was set up last night on a logging road on Edinburgh mountain (also unceded Pacheedaht Territory). With the exception of Eden Grove on Edinburgh mountain, contiguous old-growth corridors have been severed between the rich valley bottom and the protected upper reaches. The infamous Big Lonely Doug stands in stark contrast to clear cut in a cutblock on Edinburgh, the sole remaining giant fir in the cut. Lonely Doug has become an internationally recognized symbol for BC’s devastating logging practices. Just up the mountain, logging is ongoing. This is what the newest blockade will stop.

In April 2020, The BC Government finalized its commissioned report on the current state of Vancouver Island’s remaining old growth forests. The report had been anticipated since 2019 but has not yet been released to the public. The NDP’s review panel is set to release their Old Growth Strategy Report in October (OGSR herein). Meanwhile, Old Growth logging persists; roads are blasted into pristine mountains; trees are falling. Time is of the essence.

Gary Merkel, one of two OGSR commissioners, said in an interview with the Narwhal, Jan. 27, 2020: “We’re managing ecosystems — that are in some cases thousands of years old — on a four-year political cycle. The management systems change from government to government.”

The detailed demands for the Province from the Forest Defenders frontline are the following:

· Immediately release the recommendations of the Old-Growth Forest Review (OGFR), which have not been made public since the panel submitted its report in April, 2020

· The immediate and permanent end of all old growth logging in the province.

· Work with sovereign First Nations to implement a comprehensive plan for a sustainable and restorative second-growth forestry model



Some voices from the Fairy Creek blockade:

“Anyone who wonders why people are blockading, they should go and spend some time in an old growth forest, and they will understand. It’s the mosses, the spongy floor, the smell, it’s the stillness, the spaciousness.” K.L.

“Once it’s gone, it’s gone for good. It’s short-sighted to be logging like this.” J.C.

“If we pick and choose where our actions line up with our words, our words don’t mean anything. I’m an ecologist; I work with kids, I teach them about Old Growth, I teach them the value of these ecosystems. Being here means keeping a promise. If I don’t stand for this, how can I stand behind what I say to these kids?” Zoe Cilliers

Recent drone footage shows road-building crews cresting the ridge into Fairy Creek, the last intact, unlogged watershed in the San Juan River rainforest on unceded Pacheedaht land.
