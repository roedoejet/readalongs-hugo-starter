# What do I need?

To get started, you'll need to have admin access to the blog, a GitHub account, and working ReadAlongs files.

## How to make a new post

First, create a new post:

![new post](/media/new-post.png)

Then, make sure you are editing your post in "rich text" mode:

![new post](/media/richtext-mode.png)

Then, you can add your readalong anywhere you like by selecting "new ReadAlong" wherever you want to put your ReadAlong:

![new ReadAlong](/media/new-ra.png)

Then, fill out the names of the files needed for ReadAlongs. This is a text file (ends in .xml), an audio file (usually ends in .wav or .mp3) and an 'alignment' file (ends in .smil):

{{< readalongs text=/media/danish.xml alignment=/media/danish.smil audio=/media/danish.wav >}}
