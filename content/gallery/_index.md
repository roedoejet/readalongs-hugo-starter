# What do I need?

To get started, you'll need to have admin access to the blog, a GitHub account, and working ReadAlongs files.

## How to make a new post

First, create a new post:

Then, make sure you are editing your post in "rich text" mode:

Then, add your files to GitHub:

![new post](/img/gh.png)

Then, you can add your readalong anywhere you like!

Just, select "new ReadAlong" wherever you want to put your ReadAlong:

Then, fill out the names of the files you uploaded to GitHub:
