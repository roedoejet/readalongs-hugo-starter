WHO ARE WE?

The Fairy Creek Blockades were started and run by people just like you. We are a grassroots group of activist from Vancouver Island who stand by the same principal - that old growth logging needs to stop. Standing with us are teachers, environmentalists, loggers, community activists, students and workers across Vancouver Island.

WHAT DO WE WANT?\
The three main goals of the Ferry Creek Blockades are to stop Old Growth logging in the Fairy Creek Watershed; to call on John Horgan and the BC government to release the recommendations of the Old-Growth Forest Review Panel (submitted in April, but not yet released to the public) and lastly; to advocate to both government and the public for an immediate and just transition away from logging old growth forests across British Columbia.
